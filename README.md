Raspberry Pi IP Camera
======================

This is a simple webapp which allows still photos to be taken
using the Raspberry Pi camera.

Start the webserver by running ```run.sh```

Browse to: http://IP-of-rpi:5000/ and click on the "Take a snapshot" link.

It takes about six seconds for the snapshot to appear.
